# M102_IDP

This code was written by Vito Cipponeri and William Tow. It was a collabrative effort where Vito primarly worked on block detection and William on line following.

On the final competion we managed to secure 40 points, this was 20 less than expected due to 2 errors which occured during the 5 minute slot. A ghost block was detected which was a bug that was known to happen before hand and fixed, however somehow during the run it happend. We have no idea how it decided to turn around and return to the start as no LED was lit and thus no 180 spin should have happend. On a second run, we sadly did not have time to complete the full cycle.
